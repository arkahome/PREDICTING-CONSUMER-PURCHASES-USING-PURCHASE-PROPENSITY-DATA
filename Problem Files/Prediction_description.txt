The probabilities are in prediction_answer.csv file.

The item with id 24 will be showing 0.99+ probability for each customer i.e due to advertising = 1 in the model. So, it doesn't necessarily reflect the users are 99% sure of buying that item, instead it can be inferred by sorting the probability of customers buying the item,it will reflect which customers are more likely to buy the item.

For other items, the probability starts with 0.082266. We can multiply all elements with 10 and see that as the probability or likelihood of user buying. That will give us a very good estimate.

If any issues in understanding please let me know.

Thanks and regards,
